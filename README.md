# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Express.js Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improperly handling errors thrown within asynchronous middleware. The provided `bug.js` file showcases an Express app with an asynchronous operation that may fail.  The error handling is inadequate, resulting in a lack of appropriate error responses sent to the client.

The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, demonstrates a correct approach to error handling using a more robust middleware structure and the `next()` function.
